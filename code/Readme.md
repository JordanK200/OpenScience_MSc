# Code Directory

This directory contains all scripts and code used in this project.

Files are numbered in the correct sequence in which they should be run to reproduce the full scraping, cleaning, and analysis workflow.

## 01 Scripts
These scripts automatically download required data from the web. 
If you do not run these scripts before running 02_Data_Cleaning, the script will resort to using the backups stored on Google drive.

## 02 Script
Markdown file that walks through each step in the data cleaning process.
