# Data Directory
This directory contains three sub-directories to organize data:
* raw-data = unmodified input data
* intermediate-data = half-cleaned data that is stored after time consuming cleaning steps.
* clean-data = Finalized data ready for analysis.

All raw data has been stored at the following Google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FSxIsOkGuVqUTiFzEPaC4xpr_r5OvzNJ?usp=sharing

Cleaning scripts automatically download this data and produce the remaining data in the intermediate-data and clean-data directories.
